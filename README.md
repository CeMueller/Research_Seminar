## Abstract
Foreign exchange rates are notoriously difficult to predict. Decades of research in this realm has shown that no single method exists, 
which is able to effectively exploit market volatility. More recently, different ML algorithms have been practicably applied in FX 
forecasting and literature provides compelling evidence on their superiority compared to conventional time-series methodologies. 
This research paper examines the aforesaid superiority by testing the performance of a LSTM network, which is an extended RNN 
architecture, on two distinct currency trading pairs. The findings align with current literature and yield considerably better results 
for the ML algorithm on a 1 day-ahead and 5 day-ahead forecast compared to the ARIMA as well as Baseline model, which are used as 
benchmarks. Moreover, the results suggest that neural networks are promising methods in time-series analysis, especially for less 
volatile input data. However, profitable trading based on ML algorithms is highly unlikely, considering that exchange rates largely 
follow a random walk and are often impacted by unique and unpredictable exogeneous factors.
